# Whatdid privacy policy

## tl;dr:

- All data is anonymized.
- I never track data, only events like clicks.
  - I don't track any automated actions the app takes.
  - I will _never_ track content like your projects, tasks, or notes.
- I will never sell your data.
- You can opt out any time time, including having your data deleted on my server.

## What I collect, and why

**If you opt out of usage tracking, I won't collect a thing.** Not even your decision to opt out of tracking.

I would like to track a small amount of usage data in order to improve the app's UX. For example, I may track how often people edit entries to gauge whether it's a feature people know about.

If you opt into usage:

- All tracking is identified by a random, unique number that your computer generates the first time Whatdid runs. I cannot track this back to any individual or computer (and I don't want to try).
- I will never, ever, ever sell or give away the data I track. (Frankly, I don't think there'll even be anything that's worth any money â€” but even if there is, I won't do it.)
- I only track "what you used"-style events, like clicking on UI elements. I will never track the content of anything you type.
- You can ask for your data at any time, or ask for it to be deleted.
- Althugh I don't track IP addresses today, I reserve the right to do so if I need to for security reasons (for example, to look into someone DDoSing me).
  If I do, any such logs will be short-lived, and I will delete them as soon as my investigation is complete.

In short, none of the data I collect will be sensitive.
