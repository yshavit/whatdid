| 10:46 | main popup window   | autocomplete        | found one approach: NSTextFieldDelegate                           |

| 12:42 | main popup window   | styling             | went with default highlight; experimenting with focus border now  |
| 12:53 | main popup window   | styling             | good enough for prototype                                         |

| 14:02 | test infrastructure | UI test framework   | created dummy window for holding elements to test                 |
| 14:12 | test infrastructure | UI test framework   | plugged my mocked data into window's field                        |
| 14:23 | test infrastructure | UI test framework   | got validation to do something, but it's failing -- not sure why  |
