At long last, a release I feel comfortable releasing!

This release includes an updater, so at least people will get the latest as I further improve things.

Relative to [v0.0.1][1], this release also adds the ability to export data. I found this particularly useful when doing my end-of-year self evaluation, as it gave me a nice little rollup of my accomplishments. The day-end reporter barfed at that much data. :-)
